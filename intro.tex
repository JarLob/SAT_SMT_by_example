\section{Latest versions}

Latest version is always available at \url{http://yurichev.com/writings/SAT_SMT_by_example.pdf}.

Russian version has been dropped -- it's too hard for me to maintain two versions. Sorry.

Alex ``clayrat'' Gryzlov and @mztropics on twitter found couple of bugs.

Xenia Galinskaya -- for carefully measured periods of forced distraction from the work.

\section{Praise}

``An excellent source of well-worked through and motivating examples of using Z3's python interface.''

\section{Introduction}

\ac{SAT}/\ac{SMT} solvers can be viewed as solvers of huge systems of equations.
The difference is that \ac{SMT} solvers takes systems in arbitrary format,
while \ac{SAT} solvers are limited to boolean equations in \ac{CNF} form.

A lot of real world problems can be represented as problems of solving system of equations.

\section{Is it a hype? Yet another fad?}

Some people say, this is just another hype.
No, \ac{SAT} is old enough and fundamental to \ac{CS}.
The reason of increased interest to it is that computers gets faster over the last couple decades,
so there are attempts to solve old problems using \ac{SAT}/\ac{SMT}, which were inaccessible in past.
