\subsection{DFA accepting a 001 substring}

\renewcommand{\CURPATH}{synth/DFA}

\begin{lstlisting}
This example shows how to design a finite automaton E_2 to recognize the regular
language of all strings that contain the string 001 as a substring. For example,
0010, 1001, 001, and 11111110011111 are all in the language, but 11 and 0000
are not. How would you recognize this language if you were pretending to
be E_2?
