\subsection{TAOCP 7.1.1 exercises 4 and 5}

Found this exercise in \href{http://www.cs.utsa.edu/~wagner/knuth/fasc0b.pdf}{TAOCP section 7.1.1 (Boolean basics)}:

I'm not clever enough to solve this manually (yet),
but I could try using logic synthesis, as I did before.
As they say, ``machines should work; people should think''.

The modified Z3Py script:

\lstinputlisting[style=custompy]{\CURPATH/logic_for_TAOCP.py}

My solution for NAND:

\lstinputlisting{\CURPATH/nand.txt}

My solution for NAND with 0/1 constants:

\lstinputlisting{\CURPATH/nand_constants.txt}

My solution for ANDN:

\lstinputlisting{\CURPATH/andn.txt}

My solution for ANDN with 0/1 constants:

\lstinputlisting{\CURPATH/andn_constants.txt}

Correct answers from \ac{TAOCP}:

My solutions are slightly different: I haven't "pass through" instruction, so sometimes a value is copied from the input to the output using NAND/ANDN.
Also, my versions are sometimes different, but correct and has the same length.
