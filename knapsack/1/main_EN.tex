\subsection{Popsicles}
\label{popsicles}

Found this problem at \url{http://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php?title=2017_AMC_12A_Problems/Problem_1}:

\begin{framed}
\begin{quotation}

Pablo buys popsicles for his friends. The store sells single popsicles for $\$$1 each, 3-popsicle boxes for $\$$2,
and 5-popsicle boxes for $\$$3. What is the greatest number of popsicles that Pablo can buy with $\$$8?

\end{quotation}
\end{framed}

This is optimization problem, and the solution using z3:

\lstinputlisting{knapsack/1/popsicles.py}

The result:

\begin{lstlisting}
sat
[box3pop = 1,
 box5pop = 2,
 cost_total = 8,
 pop_total = 13,
 box1pop = 0]
\end{lstlisting}

% TODO See also github, oo, etc.
