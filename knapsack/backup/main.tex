\section{Organize your backups}

\renewcommand{\CURPATH}{knapsack/backup}

In the era of audio cassettes (1980s, 1990s), many music lovers recorded their own mix tapes with tracks/songs they like.
Each side of audio cassette was 30 or 45 minutes.
The problem was to make such an order of songs, so that a minimal irritating "silent" track at the end of each side would left.
Surely, you wanted to use the space as efficiently, as possible.

This is classic \emph{bin packing problem}: all bins (or cassettes) are equally sized.

Now let's advance this problem further: bins can be different.
You may want to backup your files to all sorts of storages you have: DVD-RWs, USB-sticks, remote hosts, cloud storage accounts, etc.
This is a \emph{Multiple Knapsack Problem} -- you've got several knapsacks with different sizes.

Choose any solution you like:

\begin{lstlisting}
trying to fit all the files into storages: (0, 3, 5, 7, 10) sat
* solution (5 storages):
storage0 (total=700):
    file0 (18)
    file3 (184)
    file9 (428)
allocated on storage=630 free on storage=70

Now something practical. You may want to store each file twice. And no pair must reside on a single storage.
Not a problem, just make two arrays of variables:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=custompy]
_PRE_BEGIN
...

     file1_in_storage=[Int('file1_%d_in_storage' % i) for i in range(files_n)]
     file2_in_storage=[Int('file2_%d_in_storage' % i) for i in range(files_n)]

...

         s.add(And(file1_in_storage[i]>=0, file1_in_storage[i]&lt;t))
         s.add(And(file2_in_storage[i]>=0, file2_in_storage[i]&lt;t))
         # no pair can reside on one storage:
         s.add(file1_in_storage[i] != file2_in_storage[i])

...

         s.add(storage_occupied[i]==
             Sum([If(file1_in_storage[f]==i, files[f], 0) for f in range(files_n)])+
             Sum([If(file2_in_storage[f]==i, files[f], 0) for f in range(files_n)]))

...

                 if m[file1_in_storage[f]].as_long()==i:
                     print "    file%d (1st copy) (%d)" % (f, files[f])
                 if m[file2_in_storage[f]].as_long()==i:
                     print "    file%d (2nd copy) (%d)" % (f, files[f])
...
\end{lstlisting}

The result:
