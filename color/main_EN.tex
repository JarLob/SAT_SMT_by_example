\section{Graph coloring}

It's possible to color all countries on any political map (or planar graph) using only 4 colors.
This is example from Wolfram Mathematica's website
(using \href{http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/FindInstance.html}{FindInstance}):

\begin{figure}[H]
\label{fig:pipe_shuffled}
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{color/map.png}
\caption{Colored map}
\end{figure}

( \url{https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/new-in-10/entity-based-geocomputation/find-a-four-coloring-of-a-map-of-europe.html} )

Any map or vertices on planar graph can be colored using at most 4 colors.
This is quite interesting story behind this.
This is a first serious proof finished using automated theorem prover (Coq):
\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_color_theorem}.

An example where I use graph coloring: \ref{tiling_Z3}.
