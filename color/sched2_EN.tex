\subsection{Another example}

What if we want to divide our community/company/university by groups.
There are 16 persons and, which must be divided by 4 groups, 4 persons in each.
However, several persons hate each other, maybe, for personal reasons.
Can we group all them so the "haters" would be separated?

\lstinputlisting[style=custompy]{color/sched2.py}

The result:

\begin{lstlisting}
group 0, persons: [1, 2, 5, 8]
group 1, persons: [4, 7, 9, 12]
group 2, persons: [0, 3, 11, 13]
group 3, persons: [6, 10, 14, 15]
\end{lstlisting}
