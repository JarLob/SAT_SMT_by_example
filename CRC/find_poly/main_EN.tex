\section{Finding (good) CRC polynomial}

Finding good CRC polynomial is tricky, and my results can't compete with other tested popular CRC polynomial.
Nevertheless, it was fun to use Z3 to find them.

I just generate 32 random samples, all has size between 1 and 32 bytes.
Then I flip 1..3 random bits and I add a constraint: CRC hash of the sample and hash of the modified sample (with 1..3 bits flipped) must differ.

Several polynomials for CRC8:

\begin{lstlisting}
poly=0xf9
poly=0x50
poly=0x90
...
\end{lstlisting}

... for CRC16:

\begin{lstlisting}
poly=0xf7af
poly=0x368
poly=0x268
poly=0x228
...
\end{lstlisting}

... for CRC32:

\begin{lstlisting}
poly=0x1683a5ab
poly=0x78553eda
poly=0x7a153eda
poly=0x7b353eda
...
\end{lstlisting}

... for CRC64:

\begin{lstlisting}
poly=0x8000000000000006
poly=0x926b19b536a62f10
poly=0x4a7bb0a7da78a370
poly=0xbbc781e7e83dabf0
...
\end{lstlisting}

Problem: at least this one. CRC must be able to detect errors in very long buffers, up to $2^{32}$ for CRC32. We can't feed that huge buffers to SMT solver.
I had success only with samples up to $\approx 32$ bytes.
