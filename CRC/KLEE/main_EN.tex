\subsubsection{Buffer alteration case \#1}

Sometimes, you need to alter a piece of data which is \textit{protected} by some kind of checksum or \ac{CRC}, and you can't change checksum or CRC value, but can alter piece of data so that checksum will remain the same.

Let's pretend, we've got a piece of data with ``Hello, world!'' string at the beginning and ``and goodbye'' string at the end.
We can alter 14 characters at the middle, but for some reason, they must be in \textit{a..z} limits, but we can put any characters there.
CRC64 of the whole block must be \TT{0x12345678abcdef12}.

Let's see\footnote{There are several slightly different CRC64 implementations, the one I use here can also be different from popular ones.}:

\lstinputlisting{\CURPATH/klee_CRC64.c}

Since our code uses memcmp() standard C/C++ function, we need to add \TT{--libc=uclibc} switch, so KLEE will use its own uClibc 
implementation. % \ref{} -> closed programs

\begin{lstlisting}
% clang -emit-llvm -c -g klee_CRC64.c

% time klee --libc=uclibc klee_CRC64.bc
\end{lstlisting}

It takes about 1 minute (on my Intel Core i3-3110M 2.4GHz notebook) and we getting this:

% FIXME:
\begin{lstlisting}
...
real    0m52.643s
user    0m51.232s
sys     0m0.239s
...
% ls klee-last | grep err
test000001.user.err
test000002.user.err
test000003.user.err
test000004.external.err

% ktest-tool --write-ints klee-last/test000004.ktest
ktest file : 'klee-last/test000004.ktest'
args       : ['klee_CRC64.bc']
num objects: 1
object    0: name: b'buf'
object    0: size: 46
object    0: data: b'Hello, world!.. qqlicayzceamyw ... and goodbye'
\end{lstlisting}

Maybe it's slow, but definitely faster than bruteforce.
Indeed, $log_2{26^{14}} \approx 65.8$
which is close to 64 bits.
In other words, one need $\approx 14$ latin characters to encode 64 bits.
And KLEE + \ac{SMT} solver needs 64 bits at some place it can alter to make final CRC64 value equal to what we defined.

I tried to reduce length of the \textit{middle block} to 13 characters: no luck for KLEE then, it has no space enough.

\subsubsection{Buffer alteration case \#2}

I went sadistic: what if the buffer must contain the CRC64 value which, after calculation of CRC64, will result in the same value?
Fascinatedly, KLEE can solve this.
The buffer will have the following format:

\begin{lstlisting}
Hello, world! <8 bytes (64-bit value)> and goodbye <6 more bytes>
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}
int main()
{
#define HEAD_STR "Hello, world!.. "
#define HEAD_SIZE strlen(HEAD_STR)
#define TAIL_STR " ... and goodbye"
#define TAIL_SIZE strlen(TAIL_STR)
// 8 bytes for 64-bit value:
#define MID_SIZE 8
#define BUF_SIZE HEAD_SIZE+TAIL_SIZE+MID_SIZE+6

	char buf[BUF_SIZE];
  
	klee_make_symbolic(buf, sizeof buf, "buf");

	klee_assume (memcmp (buf, HEAD_STR, HEAD_SIZE)==0);

	klee_assume (memcmp (buf+HEAD_SIZE+MID_SIZE, TAIL_STR, TAIL_SIZE)==0);
	
	uint64_t mid_value=*(uint64_t*)(buf+HEAD_SIZE);
	klee_assume (crc64 (0, buf, BUF_SIZE)==mid_value);

	klee_assert(0);

	return 0;
}
\end{lstlisting}

It works:

\begin{lstlisting}
% time klee --libc=uclibc klee_CRC64.bc
...
real    5m17.081s
user    5m17.014s
sys     0m0.319s

% ls klee-last | grep err
test000001.user.err
test000002.user.err
test000003.external.err

% ktest-tool --write-ints klee-last/test000003.ktest
ktest file : 'klee-last/test000003.ktest'
args       : ['klee_CRC64.bc']
num objects: 1
object    0: name: b'buf'
object    0: size: 46
object    0: data: b'Hello, world!.. T+]\xb9A\x08\x0fq ... and goodbye\xb6\x8f\x9c\xd8\xc5\x00'
\end{lstlisting}

8 bytes between two strings is 64-bit value which equals to CRC64 of this whole block.
Again, it's faster than brute-force way to find it.
If to decrease last spare 6-byte buffer to 4 bytes or less, KLEE works so long so I've stopped it.

\subsubsection{Recovering input data for given CRC32 value of it}

I've always wanted to do so, but everyone knows this is impossible for input buffers larger than 4 bytes.
As my experiments show, it's still possible for tiny input buffers of data, which is constrained in some way.

The CRC32 value of 6-byte ``SILVER'' string is known: \TT{0xDFA3DFDD}.
KLEE can find this 6-byte string, if it knows that each byte of input buffer is in \textit{A..Z} limits:

\lstinputlisting[numbers=left]{\CURPATH/klee_SILVER.c}

\begin{lstlisting}
% clang -emit-llvm -c -g klee_SILVER.c
...

% klee klee_SILVER.bc
...

% ls klee-last | grep err
test000013.external.err

% ktest-tool --write-ints klee-last/test000013.ktest
ktest file : 'klee-last/test000013.ktest'
args       : ['klee_SILVER.bc']
num objects: 1
object    0: name: b'str'
object    0: size: 6
object    0: data: b'SILVER'
\end{lstlisting}

Still, it's no magic: if to remove condition at lines 23..25 (i.e., if to relax constraints),
KLEE will produce some other string, which will be still correct for the CRC32 value given.

It works, because 6 Latin characters in \textit{A..Z} limits contain $\approx 28.2$ bits:
$log_2{26^6} \approx 28.2$, which is even smaller value than 32.
In other words, the final CRC32 value holds enough bits to recover $\approx 28.2$ bits of input.

The input buffer can be even bigger, if each byte of it will be in even tighter
constraints (decimal digits, binary digits, etc).

\subsubsection{In comparison with other hashing algorithms}

Things are that easy for some other hashing algorithms like \textit{Fletcher checksum},
but not for cryptographically secure ones (like MD5, SHA1, etc), they are protected from such simple cryptoanalysis.
